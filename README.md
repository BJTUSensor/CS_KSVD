# CS_KSVD
Here, we have provieded the code we used for Brillouin Distributed fiber sensors as well as the paper. 
  
  1.This code aims to reconstruct the original BGS by using  a compressed sensing method based on K-SVD algorithm.
    including:
    1. creat dictionary:   creat_dictionary.m     KSVD.m
    2. creat observation matrix:  creat_phi.m
    3. sample and reconstruct:  main.m   CS_OMP.m
    
  2.Abstract of the paper: We propose a compressed sensing method based on K-SVD for sparse transform in Brillouin optical time domain analysis(BOTDA), which can recover     original signal of 4MHz step with 15% sampling points.
